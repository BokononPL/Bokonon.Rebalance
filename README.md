# Bokonon.Rebalance
A mod for R2Northstar (Titanfall 2) balancing weapons.

### Description
The goal of this mod is to make many pilot builds and playstyles viable, as opposed to vanilla Titanfall 2 which is heavily dominated by CAR + Stim.<br>
In a nutshell, what I want is for players to be able to play any gun they find the most fun, and not feel like they're handicapping themselves, like they made the "wrong" choice.

### The following weapons have been nerfed:

- All SMGs<br>
- All ARs<br>
- Spitfire and Devotion<br>
- EVA-8 and Mozambique<br>
- DMR<br>
- Gravity Star<br>
- Melee<br>
- P2016 and RE-45<br>

### The following weapons have been buffed:
- B3 Wingman<br>
- SMR<br>
- Softball<br>
- Arc Grenade<br>
- Electric Smoke Grenade<br>
- Satchel<br>
- Thunderbolt<br>
- Archer<br>
- MGL<br>
- Pulse Blade<br>
